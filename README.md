# OpenAliasChecker

A simple and free tool to check OpenAlias configurations.

## Online Version

[https://openaliaschecker.com](https://openaliaschecker.com)

## Run Locally

To run the site locally, configure a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) with PHP support and navigate to the local address in your browser.

A JavaScript-based version is planned, which will make it easier to run locally or host on GitHub Pages without needing PHP.

## Usage

Enter the domain you'd like to check. The tool will query Google's DNS server to look for OpenAlias-related TXT records and display the result.
